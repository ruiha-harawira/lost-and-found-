# Lost and Found

## Week 7 Large group project

The focus of this app is to practice using the Full Stack we teach, (with auth) in a large scale app.

The idea of the app is to create a "billboard" style site for people to post about their animals that have gone missing, and for people who have found stray animals to post about them.

The hope is that within a small community this could be a great go to for making sure those run-away floofs make it home safely.


## The Tech

A Boilerplate is already set up for you with everything you will need to get started. This boilerplate is set up to use:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
* [Knex.js (SQL)](https://knexjs.org/)
* [Bulma (CSS framework)](https://bulma.io/documentation/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax)
* [Authenticare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/authenticare)

The migrations and seeds for the users table, and all login functionality is already set up!

The mobile responsiveness is also being handled by some neat JS and Bulma classes, be sure to incorporate that view in your project goals!

SCSS files are included in client/styles. Make sure you define your own CSS in these files too, as the files in the public folder (styles.css & styles.css.map) are generated from these .scss files (just like the bundle.js & bundle.js.map are generated from your component files) and will be overwritten.

```sh
npm install
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run
cp .env.example .env
```

To run in development:

## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

To push your local master branch to your heroku app:
```sh
npm run h:deploy
```

Run heroku migrations:
```sh
npm run h:migrate
```

Run heroku seeds:
```sh
npm run h:seed
```

If ever you need to rollback, you can also:
```sh
npm run h:rollback
```


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
